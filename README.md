# Pentago_swap

This is an eclipse Java project of the game Pentago-Swap. The rules are specified in project_specification.pdf. 

Basically, each player should choose a move and two quadrants to swap every turn until five consecutive pieces are matched. I implemented an AI agent, the implementation is in the Student_player folder. 

To execute, run the src/boardgame/ServerGui.java, then select launch - launch server(Pentago_swap.PentagoBoard), then select launch again, and you can choose two players (clients) to play the game. 

My work was to implement an AI agent to play agaist human players. To read detailed code, go to src/student_player. The rest of the code for this project came from the coursework COMP424 Artificial Intelligent taught by Jackie Cheung in McGill University.

I would recommend reading the report.pdf to understand the algorithm and implementation I used for my agent.
